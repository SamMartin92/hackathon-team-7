## User Experience
We wanted the user to easily plan out their holiday by using our budgeting app. It also shows the currency exchange rates to the user so they know how much currency they'd have to take. Plannning for this in advance would help the user be more prepared and stress-free about their money.

## Initial MVP idea

### Initial Idea

The initial idea was to make a budget-planner where you could input income / expense / target sum to plan things such as trips etc.
We ended up doing a more general finance thing that can sort of aggregate a lot of different tools depending on what you're interested in,
wether it'd be planning a budget, view stocks, currency or financial related news.
