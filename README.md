## User Experience
We wanted the user to easily plan out their holiday by using our budgeting app. It also shows the currency exchange rates to the user so they know how much currency they'd have to take with them. Planning for this in advance would help the user be more prepared and stress-free about their money. They can keep a track of their income and expenses by using this app.
​
### User stories

- **As a user**, I want help budgeting with the 50:30:20 rule **so that** I can keep my finances in order.

## Initial MVP idea

### Initial Idea

The initial idea was to make a budget-planner where you could input income / expense / target sum to plan things such as trips etc.
We ended up doing a more general finance thing that can sort of aggregate a lot of different tools depending on what you're interested in,
wether it'd be planning a budget, view stocks, currency or financial related news.
​
<< consider talking about how you planned as a team here and what tools were implemented >>
​
### Actual idea & content:
​
<< how does you final product/project match up to your initial mvp plans >>​

## Design
​
### Color Scheme:
We chose a very neutral color palete to give the webpage a professional look.

The cover image gives a basic understanding of what the site is about and to explain this further, we have added an 'Our Purpose" section. Then we have an "Our Services" section which shows what this site can be used for. The boxes in this section are buttons which take the user to the related page.
