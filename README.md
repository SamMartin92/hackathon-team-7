## Initial MVP idea

### Initial Idea

The initial idea was to make a budget-planner where you could input income / expense / target sum to plan things such as trips etc.
We ended up doing a more general finance thing that can sort of aggregate a lot of different tools depending on what you're interested in,
wether it'd be planning a budget, view stocks, currency or financial related news.
