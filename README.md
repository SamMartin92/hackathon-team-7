## User Experience
We wanted the user to easily plan out their holiday by using our budgeting app. Budgeting their monthly expenses and income would help the user be more prepared and stress-free about their money. They can use the app to keep track of their monthly spending. 
​
### User stories
- **As a user** I want to understand how to manage my income **so that** I am handling my expenses more efficiently.
- **As a user**, I want help budgeting with the 50:30:20 rule **so that** I can keep my finances in order.
- **As a user** I want to track my expenses on a monthly basis **so that** I can see how much I spend each month.
- **As a user** I want to keep up to date with the  latest news in my region **so that** I am aware of current events, especially those related to business and finance.

## Initial MVP idea

### Initial Idea

The initial idea was to make a budget-planner where you could input income / expense / target sum to plan things such as trips etc.
We ended up doing a more general finance thing that can sort of aggregate a lot of different tools depending on what you're interested in,
wether it'd be planning a budget, view stocks, currency or financial related news.
​
### Actual idea & content:
​
We made a budgeting app which also allows the user to check the latest finance and economy news. It helps the user track their expenses and saves them in the account they've signed up with so the data is not lost once they exit the site.
​
## Design
​
### Color Scheme:
We chose a very neutralcolourr palete to give the webpage a professional look.

​
The cover image gives a basic understanding of what the site is about and to explain this further, we have added an 'Our Purpose" section. Then we have an "Our Services" section which shows what this site can be used for. The boxes in this section are buttons which take the user to the related page.
